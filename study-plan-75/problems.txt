Array/String:
1768-merge-strings-alternatively (two-pointers)
1071-greatest-common-divisor-of-strings (common-factors problem)
1431-kid-with-greatest-number-of-candies (trivial greedy array problem)
605-can-place-flowers (trivial greedy array problem)
345-reverse-vowels-of-a-string (trivial two-pointers problem)
151-reverse-words-in-string, (revisited, pythonic solution is trivial, in-place solution was somewhat hard - a more successful approach was writing tests for each helper function)

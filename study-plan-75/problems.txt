Array/String:
1768-merge-strings-alternatively (two-pointers)
1071-greatest-common-divisor-of-strings (common-factors problem)
1431-kid-with-greatest-number-of-candies (trivial greedy array problem)
605-can-place-flowers (trivial greedy array problem)
345-reverse-vowels-of-a-string (trivial two-pointers problem)
151-reverse-words-in-string, (revisited, pythonic solution is trivial, in-place solution was somewhat hard - a more successful approach was writing tests for each helper function)
238-product-of-array-except-self (a problem with a trick one has to know or reason out to solve within the question constraints, and again to adapt it into an O(1) extra space solution)
334-increasing-triplet-subsequence (problem with a greedy one-pass answer - another answer that is so obvious in hindsight, with a big (but not necessary) hint from the answer being to use a/b to track values instead of indices)
443-string-compression (mostly-easy two-pointers problem)

Two-pointers:
283-move-zeros (our two pointers solutions is slow, and answer is faster) (problem is also (now) in '_revisit')
392-is-subsequence (easy as a two-pointers problem (however there are also recursive, hashmap, and dynamic-programming bottom-up/top-down solutions)) (two-pointers, recursive, and hashmap solutions are greedy (check if any subsequence can be found) (fast), while DP solutions are not and are slow in comparison)
11-container-with-most-water (greedy two-pointers problem)
1679-max-number-of-k-sum-pairs (problem is a logical continuation of two-sum) (two-pointers solution involves sorting, hashmap solution mapping values to indices is TLE, optimal solution to problem involves a Counter (one-pass solution is faster for smaller inputs, however construcing an counter-dict manually cannot beat `Counter(nums)` for larger inputs)

Sliding-window:
643-maximum-average-subarray-i (trivial sliding-window (cumulative sum) problem)
1456-max-number-of-vowels-in-substring (trivial sliding-window problem)
1004-max-consecutive-ones-iii (harder 'medium' problem, our solution is better described as two-pointers than sliding window(?))
1493-longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element (sliding-window problem more easily solved with a sliding-window approach than with two-pointers)

Prefix-sum:
1732-find-the-highest-altitude (trivial prefix-sum problem)
724-find-pivot-index (trivial prefix-sum problem)


HashMap/Set:
2215-find-the-difference-of-two-arrays (trivial set difference problem)
1657-determine-if-two-strings-are-close (trivial Counter problem)
2352-equal-row-and-column-pairs (Counter problem)
